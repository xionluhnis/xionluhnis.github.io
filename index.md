Currently, I am a PhD student in the [Computational Fabrication Group](http://cfg.mit.edu)
of Professor [Wojciech Matusik](http://people.csail.mit.edu/wojciech/).

Previously, I obtained a bachelor and master's degrees from [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch) where I worked in the [Computer Graphics and Geometry laboratory](http://lgg.epfl.ch/) of Professor [Mark Pauly](http://lgg.epfl.ch/people.php).

# Interests

My research interests include computer graphics, vision and computational fabrication
with a specific interest for inverse problems, notably inverse procedural modeling.

Beside research, I like [photography](/photos), traveling, arts (especially drawing and painting) and philosophy.
